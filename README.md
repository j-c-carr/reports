Course papers and projects, sometimes written with friends

* A Probabilistic Interpretation of Data Augmentations. A solo venture to re-think how we characterize data augmentations. Should we not think carefully about our assumptions about the learning problem when comparing data augmentation strategies?
* Error Bounds for Approximate Dynammic Programming. What are they, anyways?
* Value Function Approximation with Temporal Difference Learning. Why do we know so little about the theoretical properties of TD($\lambda$)?
* MPS GME: can we use tensor networks to speed up entanglement calculations? (yes we can!)
