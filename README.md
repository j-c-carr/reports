Course papers and projects

* **Policy Gradient Methods for Continuous Control Tasks**. Will one Mujoco Hopper rule them all? (probably, and it's the SAC)
* **Value Function Approximation with Temporal Difference Learning**. Why do we know so little about the theoretical properties of TD(Î»)?
* **Error Bounds for Approximate Dynammic Programming**. What are they, anyways?
* **A Probabilistic Interpretation of Data Augmentations**. A solo venture to characterize data augmentations based on their information about the learning problem.
* **Computing Entanglement via Tensor Network Optimization**. Can we use tensor networks to speed up quantum entanglement calculations? (yes we can!)
