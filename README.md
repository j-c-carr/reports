Course papers and projects, sometimes written with friends

* **A Probabilistic Interpretation of Data Augmentations**. A solo venture to re-think how we characterize data augmentations. Shouldn't we think carefully about our assumptions on the learning problem when comparing data augmentation strategies?
* **Error Bounds for Approximate Dynammic Programming**. What are they, anyways?
* **Value Function Approximation with Temporal Difference Learning**. Why do we know so little about the theoretical properties of TD($\lambda$)?
* **MPS GME**: can we use tensor networks to speed up quantum entanglement calculations? (yes we can!)
